# 3DPlanet
interactive 3D globe

Always wanted to make this. Tried looking for one but nothing out there really was what I was looking for so I decided to create it myself. 

You can spin, zoom, reset, and if you tap the planet, it will change to a new one. 

I borrowed planet images online. Mostly from NASA. If the other images are yours and you don't want them here, let me know and I will remove them from the demo.
